## Languages and Compilers - University Project - 2021

In this university project you can find an implementation of a compiler front-end for the MC language (MC language is a Chapel based language designed for this project).

The compiler front-end is written in Haskell + Alex and Happy tools.

A PDF report file with project description is included (written in Italian).
